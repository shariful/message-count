this file skype-messages.json is a JSON data file which contains Skype messages for a few Skype groups.

1. I need a Google sheet (xlsx will also do) containing one worksheet per group
2. For each group, the worksheet will have dates in columns and Skype users in rows
3. Each cell will contain a number, the number being the count of Skype message that the specific user wrote in that group on that day

Any scripting language Python, Javascript, etc. or any text utilities like AWK, GNU tools, shell script is fine.
